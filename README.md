## Introduction

In today's age, almost all the museums around the world make use of some kind of interactive multimedia interfaces in their exhibits to enhance the overall experience of their visitors. This project aims at presenting such an interface for a museum featuring a collection of 30 musical instruments from the Renaissance era. 

Users can navigate around the interface and interact with all the instruments, learn more about their history and evolution, their classification into percussion, woodwind, string, brass, and keyboard instruments, and even listen to how these instruments sounded like, back in those times. This interface is highly user-friendly and makes use of voice commands such as "Read the description" which reads the description pages of the instrument the user is interacting with and "How did it sound?" which plays the sound of the instrument. 

The multimedia content I created myself involves editing of all the images in the two main list pages where every image had to be cropped in a circular fashion with same dimensions so to give them a uniform look and feel. Besides this, I had to edit all the audio files downloaded from various sources from the internet and turn them into small clips for using in the interface.
